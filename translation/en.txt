[00:00.57] Tomorrow will surely be a good day A good day A good day it will be
[00:15.57] 
[00:18.27] I saw someone swaying on the train with a weary look on their face.
[00:27.66] Summoning all my courage, I offered my seat.
[00:36.23] After being turned down with a puzzled "It's fine,"
[00:45.91] The empty seat for one person, awkwardly left as is
[00:56.41] If you can't just shrug it off and say "Oh well," then make it your best joke ever. That's right.
[00:54.95] 
[01:10.95] Tomorrow will surely be a good day A good day A good day, you know
[01:06.44] 
[01:15.28] If we can laugh together, it'll be a good day It'll be a good day It'll be a good day, won't it?
[01:30.28] 
[01:33.85] From the moment I could no longer meet the person I loved
[01:42.69] A gaping hole remains in my heart
[01:51.62] Sadness always comes like a sudden rain
[02:00.88] There are days when I stand frozen, without even an umbrella.
[02:08.88] 
[02:09.43] Rain falls and trampled earth hardens When the sun shines upon it, a rainbow appears That's right
[02:24.43] Tomorrow will surely be a good day A good day A good day, you know
[02:20.98] 
[02:30.15] Every experience becomes the paint that colors you It will become the paint
[02:44.15] 
[02:50.23] Two teenagers holding hands boarded the train, smiling as they politely offered each other the single empty seat.
[03:08.57] Even if life doesn't go as planned, you can still choose to see that as happiness.
[03:24.57] 
[03:25.77] If you can't just shrug it off and move on, make it your go-to funny story.
[03:39.77] 
[03:44.45] Tomorrow will surely be a good day A good day A good day, you know
[03:53.46] If we can laugh together, it'll be a good day A good day A good day, you know
[04:02.86] Today will be a much better day A good day I'll make it a good day
[04:11.95] If you smile, it'll be a good day A good day It'll be a good day
